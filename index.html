   <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>

   <h2>Background</h2>
   <p>
     <em>Learn Enough</em> is a <strong>pretty cool</strong> program. It assumed you <strong><em>know nothing</em></strong> and starts from the very beginning in a well thought out way. To join the movement, <a href="http://learnenough.com/email">sign up for their offical email list now</a>.

   <h2>Founders</h2>

   <h3>Michael Hartl</h3>
   <p>
         Michael is the creator of the <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/">
         Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and principal author of the
         <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/">Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a>
         introductory sequence. He is an advanced student of
         <a href="https://www.kravmaga.com/">Krav Maga</a> and has a three-step
         plan for world domination. Rumors that he's secretly a supervillain
         are slightly exaggerated.
       </p>
       <p>You should follow him on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/mhartl">here</a>.</p>
       
   <h3>Lee Donahoe</h3>
   <p>
        When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes
        on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing
        interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the
        interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.
      </p>

   <h3>Nick Merwin</h3>
   <p>
        You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy
        Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd
        at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a
        tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
